## Installation

   - Clone the client directory to receive all of the files for the React build
   - Set up your environment variables in a .env file
   - Run "npm install" in the command line of your terminal to set up all of the dependencies
   - Run "npm start" to start the application's connection
   - You will automatically be taken to the url of the application (http//:localhost:3000) and you'll see the app running

### Home Screen

The home screen is built using the Canvas API and useRef hook. By keeping a reference to mouse position in between renders, we are able to draw on the canvas. See what treasures are revealed!

I can be reached at any of the handles provided.
